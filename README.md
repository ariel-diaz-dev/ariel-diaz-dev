👋 Hi there! I'm Ariel, and I'm a full stack software engineer with a passion for creating exceptional user and developer experiences. 

🔍 My Full Stack Skills:

Frontend Mastery: Skilled in JavaScript, Angular, React, and CSS, I love bringing designs to life with responsive modern interfaces.

Backend Proficiency: Experienced in .NET Core, Elixir, Ruby, and Golang. I also love making robust and scalable backend systems.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies:

Relational databases: MSSQL, MySql.

Fluent in cloud technologies like AWS and Docker, and also leveraging Terraform to setup and maintain cloud infrastructures.

Monitoring experience using SumoLogic, DataDog, and Splunk.

Testing with front end and backend tooling such as Cypress, MUnit, ExUnit, React Testing Library, Percy, DataDog Synthetic Tests and more. Testing is awesome!

🚀 Passionate About User Experience:

I strive to create intuitive and accessible UI interfaces that enhance user interaction. 

But, I have a real passion for creating well-documented RESTful APIs that are also intuitive and easy to use by other developers.

Even though APIs should be easy enough to use by themselves, thorough documentation of its endpoints, expected payloads, headers and such is a welcome addition to any API.

I'm always open to collaborating on exciting projects or just having a chat about new technologies.
